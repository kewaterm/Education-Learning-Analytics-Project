Step-by-Step DMP Creation Process
Step 1: Project Planning Phase
Before Data Collection:
1. **Define Your Research Questions**
2. **Assess Legal and Ethical Requirements**
3. **Estimate Resources and Costs**
Step 2: Technical Planning
Data Collection Design:
1. **Choose Collection Methods**
2. **Plan Data Processing Pipeline**
Example Processing Workflow:
Raw Data → Data Validation → Cleaning → Transformation → Analysis → Results
↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ Log File
Error Report Clean Data Processed Models Publication
Step 3: Documentation Templates
Create Standard Templates:
1. **Data Collection Log Template**
Date: [Collection Date] Source: [Data source URL/API] Method: [Collection
method used] Records: [Number of records collected] Issues: [Any problems
encountered] Quality: [Data quality assessment] Collector: [Person
responsible]
2. **Data Dictionary Template**
Variable Name: [Column name in dataset] Data Type: [Integer, String,
Boolean, etc.] Description: [What this variable represents] Valid Range:
[Acceptable values or ranges] Missing Values: [How missing data is coded]
Collection Method: [How this data was obtained]
3. **Version Control Template**
Version: [v1.0, v1.1, etc.] Date: [Creation/modification date] Changes:
[What was modified] Author: [Person making changes] File Location: [Where
file is stored] Dependencies: [Related files or software]
Step 4: Implementation
Setting Up Your Data Management System:
1. **Create Directory Structure**
project_name/
├── data/ │
├── raw/ │
├── processed/ │
└── final/
├── code/ │
├── collection/ │
├── processing/ │
└── analysis/
├── documentation/ │
├── protocols/ │
├── metadata/ │
└── reports/
└── outputs/
├── figures/
├── tables/
└── publications/
2. **Implement Version Control**
3. **Set Up Access Controls**
Step 5: Ongoing Management
During Data Collection:
● **Regular Quality Checks**: Monitor data quality and completeness
● **Documentation Updates**: Keep metadata current as data evolves
● **Backup Verification**: Ensure backups are working correctly
● **Compliance Monitoring**: Check adherence to legal requirements
● **Team Communication**: Regular updates on data status and issues
Monthly Review Checklist:
● Data collection on schedule?
● Storage capacity adequate?
● Backup systems functioning?
● Documentation up to date?
● No security incidents?
● Team training current?
